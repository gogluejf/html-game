# Reviews — effect-engine

Format: task → Review A (qwen3.8-27b, line-level) + Review B (openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol, intent/doc-conformance) → resolution.

## Task 1.1 — Update effects.md to the data-object spec

**Review A:** PASS
- minor: effects.md:88 — trigger table row 25 "(experimental)" inconsistent with section 25 "out of scope for v1" scoping language

**Review B:** FAIL
- major: effects.md:30 — extensibility contract omits required demo (one file + one registration only)
- major: effects.md:69 — Trail/Afterimage "continuous while moving" activation outside fixed trigger vocabulary, no lifecycle semantics
- major: effects.md:526 — Beam orientation ambiguous: sampled at fire time vs follows hitbox every frame
- major: effects.md:540 — Beam origin default unspecified ("origin/corner"); no corner-selection/pivot/coordinate-space/facing rule

**Resolution:** ACCEPT (fix). Executor applied all five findings: consistent out-of-scope wording; demo added to extensibility contract; new Continuous Activation subsection defining `{ continuous: { condition } }` config shape + single-instance lifecycle (rows 6–7 updated); Beam origin captured once at fire time / orientation tracks hitbox continuously; Beam origin default = hitbox corner nearest carrier facing (center if no facing), world coords, orientation default = long axis (facing when square). Re-verify: greps pass, suite 31/31. Committed.
